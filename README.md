# Task2
Create 1 page application using Django. 

It should have a header with different menu (itâ€™s okay if all the menu links are not working).

On click of a button on the page, user should be able to create a word file, edit it with content of his/her choice in the same page and save it in the database table (preferably PostgreSQL).

Note: User should be able to edit the file in the application itself without downloading it on the local system.
